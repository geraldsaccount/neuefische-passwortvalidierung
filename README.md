# Password Validation

This project was created as part of a teaching unit to practice and deepen the basics of Java, unit testing, Maven, and Continuous Integration (CI).

## Project Goal

The goal is to implement a password validation that checks various criteria, such as minimum length, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters. Additionally, unit tests are written to ensure the functionality of the validation. Continuous Integration is used to automatically execute the tests.

## Technologies

- **Java**: For implementing the password validation.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and the build process.
- **JUnit**: For writing and executing unit tests.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: For automatically running the tests upon changes.

## Learning Objectives

- Basics of Java programming
- Working with control structures and string methods
- Introduction to Maven and build management
- Writing unit tests with JUnit
- Introduction to Continuous Integration
